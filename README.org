#+title: Pong on FPGA

* Overview

This is a VHDL implementation of 1D Pong for the [[https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual][Basys3 board]]. The playing field is mapped to a single-dimensional array of 16 LEDs and the left/right buttons act as paddles. The lit up LED represents the ball moving across the field.

* How It Works

- *Gameplay:* Players hit the paddle button when the ball (LED) reaches their end. Early/late hits end the round and score a point for the opponent.

- *Speed:* On each successful return, the ball speed is incremented. By default, the initial speed is 2 LEDs/sec and is incremented at a rate of 1 LED/sec per level. And there are a total of 7 levels. The initial speed and increment is parameterized by the INITIAL_SPEED and SPEED_INCREMENT generics.

- *Serving:* Serve alternates every round, regardless of who won the previous point.

- *Scoring:* By default, first to 7 points with a 2-point lead wins. Scores (up to 99) are shown on the seven-segment displays. Parameterized by the MIN_WIN_SCORE and WIN_BY_SCORE generics.

- *Victory:* LEDs show a victory pattern at the end of each round. The pattern shown depends on who won that round and lasts for 1 sec by default. This can be configured by setting the LEFT_WIN_PATTERN, RIGHT_WIN_PATTERN, and PATTERN_PERIOD generics.

- *Reset:* The down button resets the game.
